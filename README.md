# Yet Another Effect System (λÆS)
<img align="right" src="./logo.svg" width="230" alt="logo" />

λÆS is an experimental effect system in Scala inspired by the ideas behind Algebraic Effects. Using Scala 3 [context parameters](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/using-clauses.html) and [context functions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/context-functions.html), it provides a way to define and handle effects in a modular and composable manner.

You can visit the dedicated [website](https://rcardin.github.io/yaes/) 🌐.

Here is the talk I gave at the **Scalar 2025** about the main concepts behind the library:
<br clear="both" />

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/TXUxCsPpZp0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/TXUxCsPpZp0)

Available modules are:
 * `yaes-core`: The main effects of the λÆS library.
 * `yaes-data`: A set of data structures that can be used with the λÆS library.
 * `yaes-cats`: Integration with Cats and Cats Effect, providing interoperability and typeclass instances.
 * `yaes-slf4j`: SLF4J integration for the `Log` effect, enabling any SLF4J-compatible logging backend.
 * `yaes-http`: HTTP client and server built on λÆS effects, with optional Circe and jsoniter-scala JSON support.
 * `yaes-test`: Testing utilities for λÆS effects, including ScalaTest integration.

What's new in λÆS when compared to other effect systems? Well, λÆS embraces direct style — no monads, no for-comprehensions, just plain Scala:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Random.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def drunkFlip(using Random, Raise[String]): String = {
  val caught = Random.nextBoolean
  if (caught) {
    val heads = Random.nextBoolean
    if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
  } else {
    Raise.raise("We dropped the coin")
  }
}
```

In λÆS types like `Random` and `Raise` are *Effects*. A *Side Effect* is an unpredictable interaction, usually with an external system. An Effect System manages *Side Effects* by tracking and wrapping them into *Effects*. An *Effect* describes the type of the *Side Effect* and the return type of an effectful computation. We manage *Side Effect* behavior by putting them in a kind of box.
Calling the above `drunkFlip` function will not execute the effects. Instead, it will return a value that represents something that can be run but hasn’t yet. This is called deferred execution. 

An Effect System provides all the tools to manage and execute Effectful computations in a deferred manner. In λÆS, such tools are called *Handlers*.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Random.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val result: String = Raise.run { 
  Random.run { 
    drunkFlip
  }
}
```

In the above code, we are running the `drunkFlip` function with the `Random` and `Raise` effects. The `Raise.run` and `Random.run` functions are defined using *Handlers* that will execute the deferred effects. The approach reminds the one defined in the Algebraic Effects and Handlers theory. The example shows how to handle the `Raise` and `Random` effects one at a time. However, we're free to handle only one effect at a time:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Random.*

val result: Raise[String] ?=> String = Random.run { 
  drunkFlip
}
```

The above code shows how to handle only the `Random` effect. The `Raise` effect is still present. It's a powerful feature that allows for a fine-grained management of the effects.

## Dependency

The library is available on Maven Central. To use it, add the following dependency to your build.sbt files:

**For effects only** (Raise, Async, Sync, etc.):

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "in.rcard.yaes" %% "yaes-core" % "0.20.0"
```

**For effects + data structures** (Flow, Channel, and reactive streams):

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "in.rcard.yaes" %% "yaes-data" % "0.20.0"
```

**For Cats integration** (includes all effects and data structures):

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "in.rcard.yaes" %% "yaes-cats" % "0.20.0"
```

**For SLF4J logging integration** (delegates `Log` effect to any SLF4J backend):

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "in.rcard.yaes" %% "yaes-slf4j" % "0.20.0"
```

```

The library is only available for Scala 3 and is currently in an experimental stage. The API is subject to change.

### Requirements

- **Java 24 or higher** is required to run λÆS due to its use of modern Java features like Virtual Threads and Structured Concurrency.

## Usage

The library provides a set of effects and handlers that can be used to define and handle effectful computations. The available effects are:

- [`Sync`](#the-sync-effect): Allows for running side-effecting operations.
- [`Async`](#the-async-effect): Allows for asynchronous computations and fiber management.
- [`Raise`](#the-raise-effect): Allows for raising and handling errors.
- [`Resource`](#the-resource-effect): Allows for automatic resource management with guaranteed cleanup.
- [`Shutdown`](#the-shutdown-effect): Allows for graceful shutdown coordination with callback hooks.
- [`Input`](#the-input-effect): Allows for reading input from the console.
- [`Output`](#the-output-effect): Allows for printing output to the console.
- [`Random`](#the-random-effect): Allows for generating random content.
- [`Clock`](#the-clock-effect): Allows for managing time.
- [`System`](#the-system-effect): Allows for managing system properties and environment variables.
- [`State`](#the-state-effect): Allows for stateful computations in a purely functional manner.
- [`Writer`](#the-writer-effect): Allows for pure, append-only value accumulation.
- [`Reader`](#the-reader-effect): Allows for read-only access to environment values.
- [`Log`](#the-log-effect): Allows for logging messages at different levels.

The library also provides the following handlers that orchestrate existing effects:

- [`Retry`](#the-retry-handler): Retries failing blocks according to composable schedule policies.

### YaesApp: Common Entry Point

For building complete applications, λÆS provides `YaesApp`, a trait that simplifies application development by automatically handling common effects in the correct order.

**Quick Example:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.*

object MyApp extends YaesApp {
  override def run {
    Output.printLn(s"Hello! Starting with args: ${args.mkString(", ")}")

    val currentTime = Clock.now
    Output.printLn(s"Current time: $currentTime")

    val randomNumber = Random.nextInt
    Output.printLn(s"Random number: $randomNumber")
  }
}
```

`YaesApp` automatically provides:
- **Sync** - Tracking side-effecting computations
- **Output**, **Input** - Console I/O
- **Random** - Random number generation
- **Clock** - Time operations
- **System** - System properties and environment variables

For more details, see the [YaesApp documentation](docs/yaes-app.md).

### The `Sync` Effect

The `Sync` effect allows for running side-effecting operations:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Sync.*

case class User(name: String)

def saveUser(user: User)(using Sync): Long =
  throw new RuntimeException("Read timed out")
```

The above code can throw an uncontrolled exception if the connection with the database times out. The generic `Sync` effect lift the function in the world of the effectful computations, making it referentially transparent. It means that everything that is not referentially transparent should be defined using the `Sync` effect. In fact, the `Sync` effect provides a guard rail to uncontrolled exceptions since its handler returns always a monad that wraps the result of the effectful computation.


To run the effectful computation, we can use the provided handlers.

The first handler doesn't block the current thread:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Sync.*

import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val result: Future[Long] = Sync.run {
  saveUser(User("John"))
}
```

The library also provides a blocking handler that will block the current thread until the effectful computation is finished:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Sync.*

import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.concurrent.duration.DurationInt
import scala.util.Try

val result: Long = Sync.runBlocking(2.seconds) {
  saveUser(User("John"))
}
```

Please, be aware that running a `Sync` effectful computation both using the `Sync.run` and `Sync.runBlocking` methods breaks the referential transparency. Handlers should be used only at the edge of the application.

The default `Sync` handler is implemented using Java Virtual Threads machinery. For every effectful computation, a new virtual thread is created and the computation is executed in that thread. 

### The `Async` Effect

The `Async` effect is built around the ideas developed in the [Sus4s](https://github.com/rcardin/sus4s) library. It allows for running asynchronous computations and managing fibers.

The default implementation of the `Async` effect is based Java Structured Concurrency provided by Java versions after 21. The `Async` effect provides a way to define asynchronous computations that are executed in a structured way. It means that every asynchronous computation is executed in a fiber that is managed by the `Async` effect.

The most important operation of the `Async` effect is the `fork` operation:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*

def findUserByName(name: String): Option[User] = Some(User(name))
val fb: Async ?=> Fiber[Option[User]] = Async.fork { findUserByName("John") }
```

The `fb` variable represent a fiber (lightweight thread) that is executing the `findUserByName` function. The `fork` operation returns a `Fiber` object that can be used to manage the execution of the asynchronous computation. In details, we can wait for the value of the computation using the `value` operation:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val maybeUser: (Async, Raise[Cancelled]) ?=> Option[User] = fb.value
```

Or, we can just wait for the computation to finish:

```scala 3
val p: Async ?=> Option[User] = fb.join()
```

As for the `Sync` effect, forking a new fiber or joining it doesn't execute the effectful computation. It just returns a value that represents the computation that can be run but hasn't yet.

Again, we can run the effectful computation using the provided handlers:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*

val maybeUser: Raise[Cancelled] ?=> Option[User] = Async.run {
    val fb: Async ?=> Fiber[Option[User]] = Async.fork { findUserByName("John") }
    fb.value
  }
```

The above code shows another important aspect of the λÆS library. We can handle an effect eliminating it from the list of effects one at time. In the above code, we are handling the `Async` effect first, and we remain with the `Raise` effect. It's a powerful feature that allows for a fine-grained management of the effects.

The `Async` effect is transparent to possible exceptions thrown by the effectful computation. Please, add the `Sync` effect if you think the effectful computation can throw any exception.

#### Structured Concurrency

The `Async` effect implements **structured concurrency**. The `Async.run` handler creates a new structured concurrency scope where all the fibers are executed. The `Async.run` will wait for all the fibers to finish before returning the result of the effectful computation both if the fibers are joined or not.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*

def updateUser(user: User): Unit                = ???
def updateClicks(user: User, clicks: Int): Unit = ???

Async.run {
  val john = User("John")
  Async.fork {
    updateUser(john)
  }
  Async.fork {
    updateClicks(john, 10)
  }
}
```

The `Async.run` function will wait for both the `updateUser` and `updateClicks` functions to finish before returning. It's a powerful feature that allows for a structured way to manage the execution of asynchronous computations.

Another important feature of strutctured concurrency is the *cancellation* of the fibers. Canceling a fiber is possible by calling the `cancel` method on the `Fiber` instance. The following code snippet shows how:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue

val actualQueue = Async.run {
  val queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue[String]()
  val cancellable = Async.fork {
    Async.delay(2.seconds)
    queue.add("cancellable")
  }
  val fb = Async.fork {
    Async.delay(500.millis)
    `cancellable.cancel()`
    queue.add("fb2")
  }
  cancellable.join()
  queue
}
```

Cancellation is collaborative. In the above example, the fiber `cancellable` is marked for cancellation by the call `cancellable.cancel()`. However, the fiber is not immediately canceled. The fiber is canceled when it reaches the first operation that can be interrupted by the JVM. Hence, cancellation is based on the concept of interruption. In the above example, the `cancellable` is canceled when it reaches the `delay(2.seconds)` operation. The fiber will never be canceled if we remove the delay operation. A similar behavior is implemented by Kotlin coroutines (see [Kotlin Coroutines - A Comprehensive Introduction / Cancellation](https://rockthejvm.com/articles/kotlin-101-coroutines#cancellation) for further details).

Cancelling a fiber follows the relationship between parent and child jobs. If a parent's fiber is canceled, all the children's fibers are canceled as well:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue

val actualQueue = Async.run {
  val queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue[String]()
  val fb1 = Async.fork("fb1") {
    Async.fork("inner-fb") {
      Async.fork("inner-inner-fb") {
        Async.delay(6.seconds)
        queue.add("inner-inner-fb")
      }

      Async.delay(5.seconds)
      queue.add("innerfb")
    }
    Async.delay(1.second)
    queue.add("fb1")
  }
  Async.fork("fb2") {
    Async.delay(500.millis)
    fb1.cancel()
    queue.add("fb2")
  }
  queue
}
```

Trying to get the value from a canceled fiber will raise a `Cancelled` error. However, joining a canceled fiber will not raise any error.

#### Structured Concurrency Primitives

Using the `Async.fork` DSL is quite low-level. The library provides a set of structured concurrency primitives that can be used to define more complex asynchronous computations. The available primitives are:

- `Async.par`: Runs two asynchronous computations in parallel and returns both.
- `Async.race`: Runs two asynchronous computations in parallel and returns the result of the first computation that finishes. The other one is canceled.
- `Async.racePair`: Runs two asynchronous computations in parallel and returns the result of the first computation that finishes along with the fiber that is still running.
- `Async.parTraverse`: Executes a function over all elements of a collection in parallel, returning results in input order.

#### Parallel Traversal

When you need to apply the same operation to every element of a collection in parallel, use `Async.parTraverse`. It forks one fiber per element, waits for all to finish, and returns the results **in the same order as the input**. If any computation fails, the remaining fibers are automatically cancelled (fail-fast):

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*

case class UserProfile(id: Int, name: String)
def fetchUserProfile(id: Int)(using Async): UserProfile = ???

val profiles: Seq[UserProfile] = Async.run {
  Async.parTraverse(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))(fetchUserProfile)
}
```

`parTraverse` also composes seamlessly with other effects such as `Raise`:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def validateAndFetch(id: Int)(using Async, Raise[String]): UserProfile =
  if (id <= 0) Raise.raise(s"Invalid id: $id")
  else fetchUserProfile(id)

val result: Either[String, Seq[UserProfile]] = Raise.either {
  Async.run {
    Async.parTraverse(List(1, 2, 3))(validateAndFetch)
  }
}
```

#### Graceful Shutdown Integration

For long-running applications and daemon processes, the `Async.withGracefulShutdown` handler provides automatic shutdown coordination with the `Shutdown` effect. This handler ensures your application can cleanly terminate concurrent operations within a specified deadline.

When shutdown is initiated (either via JVM signals like SIGTERM/SIGINT or programmatically), the handler gives your main task a deadline to complete cleanup operations. If the deadline expires, remaining fibers are cooperatively cancelled and `Async.ShutdownTimedOut` is raised. This prevents hanging shutdowns while allowing in-flight work to complete gracefully.

```scala
import in.rcard.yaes.{Async, Shutdown, Raise}
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.{Deadline, ShutdownTimedOut}
import scala.concurrent.duration.*

val result: Either[ShutdownTimedOut, Unit] = Shutdown.run {
  Raise.either {
    Async.withGracefulShutdown(Deadline.after(30.seconds)) {
      val serverFiber = Async.fork("server") {
        while (!Shutdown.isShuttingDown()) {
          // Accept and process work
        }

        Shutdown.initiateShutdown()
        // Cleanup after shutdown
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For complete documentation including lifecycle details, deadline configuration, and practical examples, see [Async Effect - Graceful Shutdown](https://rcardin.github.io/yaes/effects/async.html#graceful-shutdown-with-async).

### The `Raise` Effect

The `Raise[E]` type describes the possibility that a function can raise an error of type `E`. `E` can be a logic typed error or an exception. The DSL is heavily inspired by the [`raise4s`](https://github.com/rcardin/raise4s) library.

Let's see an example:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def divide(a: Int, b: Int)(using Raise[ArithmeticException]): Int =
  if (b == 0) Raise.raise(new ArithmeticException("Division by zero"))
  else a / b
```

In the above example, the `divide` function can raise an `ArithmeticException` if the second parameter is zero. In the example, we used an exception as the error type. However, we can use any type as the error type: 

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

object DivisionByZero
type DivisionByZero = DivisionByZero.type

def divide(a: Int, b: Int)(using Raise[DivisionByZero]): Int =
  if (b == 0) Raise.raise(DivisionByZero)
  else a / b
```

For more concise syntax, you can use the `raises` infix type:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Raise, raises}

// Using the raises infix type
def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int raises DivisionByZero =
  if (b == 0) Raise.raise(DivisionByZero)
  else a / b

// Equivalent to using Raise[E] explicitly
def divideExplicit(a: Int, b: Int)(using Raise[DivisionByZero]): Int =
  if (b == 0) Raise.raise(DivisionByZero)
  else a / b
```

The effect offers some functions to lift an program into an effectful computation that uses the `Raise[E]` effect. For example, we can rewrite the above example using the `ensure` utility function:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def divide(a: Int, b: Int)(using Raise[DivisionByZero]): Int =
  Raise.ensure(b != 0) { DivisionByZero }
  a / b
```

If we know that a function can throw an exception, we can catch it and trasform it into an error of type `E` with the `catching` function:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def divide(a: Int, b: Int)(using Raise[DivisionByZero]): Int =
  Raise.catching[ArithmeticException] {
    a / b
  } { _ => DivisionByZero }
```

The effect defines many handlers to deal with the raised errors. For example, we can execute the effectful computation and handle the raised error as a union type:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val divisionByZeroResult: Int | DivisionByZero = Raise.run {
    divide(10, 0)
  }
```

Alternatively, we can handle the raised error transforming it into an `Either` type:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val divisionByZeroResult: Either[DivisionByZero, Int] = Raise.either {
  divide(10, 0)
}
```

If we're not interested in propagating the exact reason of error, we can use the `option` handler. The `option` handler requires the block to raise `None` explicitly:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def safeDivide(x: Int, y: Int)(using Raise[None.type]): Int =
  if (y == 0) then Raise.raise(None)
  else x / y

val divisionByZeroResult: Option[Int] = Raise.option {
  safeDivide(10, 0)
}
// divisionByZeroResult will be None
```

We can even ignore the raised error returning a `Null` value. The `nullable` handler requires the block to raise `null` explicitly:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def safeDivide(x: Int, y: Int)(using Raise[Null]): Int =
  if (y == 0) then Raise.raise(null)
  else x / y

val divisionByZeroResult: Int | Null = Raise.nullable {
  safeDivide(10, 0)
}
// divisionByZeroResult will be null
```

#### Error Mapping with `MapError`

The `Raise` effect provides a powerful `MapError` strategy that allows you to automatically map errors from one type to another using a `given` instance. This is particularly useful when you need to transform errors in a compositional way across different layers of your application.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

// Define different error types for different layers
sealed trait DatabaseError
case object ConnectionTimeout extends DatabaseError
case object RecordNotFound extends DatabaseError

sealed trait ServiceError
case class ValidationFailed(message: String) extends ServiceError
case class OperationFailed(cause: String) extends ServiceError

// A function that raises DatabaseError
def findUserInDatabase(id: Int)(using Raise[DatabaseError]): User =
  if (id < 0) Raise.raise(RecordNotFound)
  else User(s"User$id")

// Use MapError to automatically transform DatabaseError to ServiceError
def findUser(id: Int)(using Raise[ServiceError]): User = {
  // Define the mapping strategy as a given instance
  given MapError[DatabaseError, ServiceError] = MapError {
    case ConnectionTimeout => OperationFailed("Database unavailable")
    case RecordNotFound => ValidationFailed("User not found")
  }
  
  // The error will be automatically mapped from DatabaseError to ServiceError
  findUserInDatabase(id)
}

// Usage
val result: ServiceError | User = Raise.run {
  findUser(-1)
}
// result will be ValidationFailed("User not found")
```

The `MapError` strategy is particularly useful when working with layered architectures where different layers define their own error types, allowing for clean separation of concerns while maintaining composability.

#### Error Accumulation

The `Raise` effect allows you to accumulate multiple errors instead of short-circuiting on the first one using `accumulate` and `accumulating`:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def validateName(name: String)(using Raise[String]): String =
  if (name.nonEmpty) name else Raise.raise("Name cannot be empty")

def validateAge(age: Int)(using Raise[String]): Int =
  if (age >= 0) age else Raise.raise("Age cannot be negative")

val result = Raise.either {
  Raise.accumulate {
    val name = accumulating { validateName("") }
    val age = accumulating { validateAge(-1) }
    (name, age)
  }
}
// result will be Left(List("Name cannot be empty", "Age cannot be negative"))
```

⚠️ **Important**: When using the `accumulate` function with lists or other collections, you **must** assign the result to a variable before returning it. Direct return of accumulated collections may not work correctly.

```scala 3
// ✅ CORRECT - Assign to variable first
val result = Raise.either {
  Raise.accumulate {
    val processedItems = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).map { i =>
      accumulating {
        if (i % 2 == 0) Raise.raise(i.toString)
        else i
      }
    }
    processedItems  // Return the assigned variable
  }
}

// ❌ INCORRECT - Direct return may not work
val result = Raise.either {
  Raise.accumulate {
    List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).map { i =>
      accumulating {
        if (i % 2 == 0) Raise.raise(i.toString)
        else i
      }
    }  // Direct return without assignment
  }
}
```

The `mapAccumulating` function allows you to transform collections while accumulating any errors that occur during the transformation. This is useful when you want to process all elements and collect all errors rather than stopping at the first failure.

**Simple Error Accumulation:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def validateNumber(n: Int)(using Raise[String]): Int =
  if (n > 0) n else Raise.raise(s"$n is not positive")

// Transform all elements, accumulating errors
val result = Raise.either {
  Raise.mapAccumulating(List(1, -2, 3, -4, 5)) { number =>
    validateNumber(number)
  }
}
// result will be Left(List("-2 is not positive", "-4 is not positive"))

// With all valid inputs
val successResult = Raise.either {
  Raise.mapAccumulating(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) { number =>
    validateNumber(number)
  }
}
// successResult will be Right(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

**Custom Error Combination:**

For more complex error types, you can provide a custom error combination function:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

case class ValidationErrors(errors: List[String])

def combineErrors(error1: ValidationErrors, error2: ValidationErrors): ValidationErrors =
  ValidationErrors(error1.errors ++ error2.errors)

def validateUserData(data: String)(using Raise[ValidationErrors]): String =
  if (data.isEmpty) Raise.raise(ValidationErrors(List("Data cannot be empty")))
  else if (data.length < 3) Raise.raise(ValidationErrors(List("Data too short")))
  else data

val result = Raise.either {
  Raise.mapAccumulating(List("Alice", "", "Bo", "Charlie"), combineErrors) { userData =>
    validateUserData(userData)
  }
}
// result will be Left(ValidationErrors(List("Data cannot be empty", "Data too short")))
```

#### Polymorphic Error Accumulation

The `accumulate` function is polymorphic and can collect errors into different collection types beyond `List`. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure at compile-time that at least one error occurred (using `NonEmptyList` or `NonEmptyChain` from Cats).

**Using NonEmptyList** (requires `yaes-cats` module):

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Raise, RaiseNel}  // RaiseNel is an alias for Raise[NonEmptyList[E]]
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.accumulating
import in.rcard.yaes.instances.accumulate.given  // Import collector instances
import cats.data.NonEmptyList

def validatePositive(n: Int)(using Raise[String]): Int =
  if (n > 0) n else Raise.raise(s"$n is not positive")

val result: Either[NonEmptyList[String], (Int, Int)] = Raise.either {
  Raise.accumulate[NonEmptyList, String, (Int, Int)] {
    val a = accumulating { validatePositive(-1) }
    val b = accumulating { validatePositive(-2) }
    (a, b)
  }
}
// result will be Left(NonEmptyList("-1 is not positive", List("-2 is not positive")))

// Or using the RaiseNel type alias for cleaner signatures:
val cleanerResult: RaiseNel[String] ?=> (Int, Int) =
  Raise.accumulate[NonEmptyList, String, (Int, Int)] {
    val a = accumulating { validatePositive(-1) }
    val b = accumulating { validatePositive(-2) }
    (a, b)
  }
```

**Using NonEmptyChain** (requires `yaes-cats` module):

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.RaiseNec  // RaiseNec is an alias for Raise[NonEmptyChain[E]]
import cats.data.NonEmptyChain

val result: Either[NonEmptyChain[String], List[Int]] = Raise.either {
  Raise.accumulate[NonEmptyChain, String, List[Int]] {
    val numbers = List(1, -2, 3, -4, 5).map { n =>
      accumulating { validatePositive(n) }
    }
    numbers
  }
}
// result will be Left(NonEmptyChain("-2 is not positive", "-4 is not positive"))

// Or using the RaiseNec type alias:
val cleanerResult: RaiseNec[String] ?=> List[Int] =
  Raise.accumulate[NonEmptyChain, String, List[Int]] {
    val numbers = List(1, -2, 3, -4, 5).map { n =>
      accumulating { validatePositive(n) }
    }
    numbers
  }
```

**Using List** (default behavior):

```scala 3
val result: Either[List[String], (Int, Int)] = Raise.either {
  Raise.accumulate[List, String, (Int, Int)] {
    val a = accumulating { validatePositive(-1) }
    val b = accumulating { validatePositive(-2) }
    (a, b)
  }
}
// result will be Left(List("-1 is not positive", "-2 is not positive"))
```

The type parameter `M[_]` specifies the collection type for errors. The system requires an `AccumulateCollector[M]` instance to convert the internal error list to type `M[Error]`. Built-in collectors are provided for `List`, and the `yaes-cats` module provides collectors for `NonEmptyList` and `NonEmptyChain`.

**Type Aliases:** The `yaes-cats` module provides convenient type aliases:
- `RaiseNel[E]` = `Raise[NonEmptyList[E]]`
- `RaiseNec[E]` = `Raise[NonEmptyChain[E]]`

These aliases make function signatures cleaner and follow Cats library conventions.

#### Error Tracing

The `traced` function adds debugging capabilities by capturing stack traces when errors occur:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

// Define custom tracing behavior
given TraceWith[String] = trace => {
  println(s"Error: ${trace.original}")
  trace.printStackTrace()
}

def riskyOperation(value: Int)(using Raise[String]): Int =
  if (value < 0) Raise.raise("Negative value not allowed")
  else value * 2

val result = Raise.either {
  traced {
    riskyOperation(-5)
  }
}
// Prints error details and stack trace, then returns Left("Negative value not allowed")
```

You can also use the default tracing strategy:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.given  // Import default tracing

val result = Raise.either {
  traced {
    Raise.raise("Something went wrong")
  }
}
// Automatically prints stack trace
```

**Note**: Tracing has performance implications since it creates full stack traces.

### The `Resource` Effect

The `Resource` effect provides automatic resource management with guaranteed cleanup. It ensures that all acquired resources are properly released in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order, even when exceptions occur. This is particularly useful for managing files, database connections, network connections, and other resources that need explicit cleanup.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Resource.*
import java.io.{FileInputStream, FileOutputStream}

def copyFile(source: String, target: String)(using Resource): Unit = {
  val input = Resource.acquire(new FileInputStream(source))
  val output = Resource.acquire(new FileOutputStream(target))
  
  // Copy file contents
  val buffer = new Array[Byte](1024)
  var bytesRead = input.read(buffer)
  while (bytesRead != -1) {
    output.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead)
    bytesRead = input.read(buffer)
  }
}
```

The `Resource` effect provides several methods for resource management:

- `Resource.acquire`: For resources that implement `AutoCloseable`, automatically calling `close()` when the scope ends
- `Resource.install`: For custom resource management with explicit acquisition and release functions
- `Resource.ensuring`: For registering cleanup actions that don't involve specific resources

Here's an example using custom resource management:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Resource.*

def processWithConnection()(using Resource): String = {
  val connection = Resource.install(openDatabaseConnection()) { conn =>
    conn.close()
    println("Database connection closed")
  }
  
  Resource.ensuring {
    println("Processing completed")
  }
  
  // Use connection safely
  connection.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users")
}
```

To execute resource-managed code, use the `Resource.run` handler:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Resource.*

val result = Resource.run {
  copyFile("source.txt", "target.txt")
  processWithConnection()
}
// All resources are automatically cleaned up here, even if exceptions occurred
```

The `Resource` effect guarantees that:
- Resources are cleaned up in reverse order of acquisition (LIFO)
- Cleanup occurs even if exceptions are thrown
- Resource cleanup exceptions are handled appropriately
- Original exceptions from the main program are preserved

### The `Shutdown` Effect

The `Shutdown` effect provides graceful shutdown coordination for long-running applications. It automatically handles JVM shutdown signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT, Ctrl+C) and provides mechanisms to cleanly terminate concurrent operations while rejecting new work.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Shutdown.*

def processWork()(using Shutdown): Unit = {
  while (!Shutdown.isShuttingDown()) {
    // Process work items
    println("Processing...")
    Thread.sleep(1000)
  }
  println("Shutdown initiated, stopping work")
}
```

The `Shutdown` effect provides three main operations:

- `Shutdown.isShuttingDown()`: Checks if shutdown has been initiated
- `Shutdown.initiateShutdown()`: Manually triggers graceful shutdown
- `Shutdown.onShutdown(hook)`: Registers callbacks to execute when shutdown begins

Here's an example using shutdown hooks:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Shutdown.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Output.*

def serverWithHooks()(using Shutdown, Output): Unit = {
  Shutdown.onShutdown(() => {
    Output.printLn("Shutdown signal received")
    Output.printLn("Stopping new request acceptance")
  })

  while (!Shutdown.isShuttingDown()) {
    // Accept and process requests
  }
}
```

To run shutdown-aware code, use the `Shutdown.run` handler:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Shutdown.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Output.*

Shutdown.run {
  Output.run {
    serverWithHooks()
  }
}
// Automatically responds to Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, and container stop signals
```

The `Shutdown` effect is particularly useful when combined with the `Async` effect for daemon processes and long-running services. It ensures graceful termination by:

- Automatically registering JVM shutdown hooks
- Providing state checks to reject new work during shutdown
- Executing registered callbacks in order when shutdown is initiated
- Being idempotent - multiple shutdown calls are safe
- Wrapping hooks in exception handling so one failure doesn't prevent others

### The `Input` Effect

Every time we need to read input from the console, we can use the `Input` effect. The `Input` effect provides a set of operations to read input from the console. Since the project is still in an experimental stage, the only one developed operation is the `readLn` function that reads a line from the console:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Input.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*
import java.io.IOException

val name: (Input, Raise[IOException]) ?=> String = Input.readLn()
```

The effect uses the Scala `scala.io.StdIn` object under the hood, which uses the Java `System.in` object to read input from the console. Reading from the console can result in an `IOException`, so the `Input` effect requires a `Raise[IOException]` effect.

To run the effectful computation, we can use the provided handlers, which returns the read line:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Input.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*
import java.io.IOException

val result: Either[IOException, String] = Raise.either {
  Input.run {
    name
  }
}
```

In the above example, we use `Raise.either` to handle any `IOException` that may be thrown by the `Input` effect, returning an `Either[IOException, String]` that wraps the result or the exception.

### The `Output` Effect

The `Output` effect provides a set of operations to print output to the console. Is uses the `scala.Console` object under the hood.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Output.*

val program: Output ?=> Unit = Output.printLn("Hello, world!")
```

As we can see, outputting to the console doesn't raise any error. The behavior mimics exactly the one exposed by the `scala.Console`, which silently ignores any error that can occur during the output operation.

To run the effectful computation, we can use the provided handlers:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Output.*

// Prints "Hello, world!" to the console
Output.run {
  program
}
```

In a similar way, we can output to system err using the `printErr` function:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Output.*

val program: Output ?=> Unit = Output.printErr("Hello, world!")
```

### The `Random` Effect

The `Random` effect provides a set of operations to generate random content. If we need to generate non-deterministic content, we can use it. Under the hood, the effect uses the `scala.util.Random` object. As we saw in the introduction, we can use the `Random` effect to define a function that generates a random boolean:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Random.*

def flipCoin(using Random): Boolean = Random.nextBoolean
```

The other random content we can generate is:

- `nextInt`: Generates a random integer.
- `nextDouble`: Generates a random double.
- `nextLong`: Generates a random long.
- `nextUuid`: Generates an RFC 4122 version 4 UUID as a lowercase `String`. Derived from two `nextLong` calls so the handler fully controls the result.

As usual, we can run the effectful computation using the provided handlers:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Random.*

val result: Boolean = Random.run {
  flipCoin
}
```

### The `Clock` Effect

The `Clock` effect provides a set of operations to manage time effectfully. It's possible to get the current time, even in a monotonic way. The `Clock.now` function returns a `java.time.Instant`, while the `Clock.nowMonotonic` returns a strictly monotonically increasing time value, guaranteed to always move forward. Returns a `Duration` rather than an Instant because monotonic time represents the time elapsed since some arbitrary starting point, not a specific point in calendar time.

Both functions use the `java.time` package under the hood.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Clock.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Output.*

val program = Output.run {
  Clock.run {
    val now = Clock.now()
    val nowMonotonic = Clock.nowMonotonic()
    Output.printLn(s"Now: $now")
    Output.printLn(s"Now monotonic: $nowMonotonic")
  }
}
```

### The `System` Effect

The `System` effect provides a set of operations to manage system properties and environment variables. It allows for reading system properties and environment variables in a type-safe way.

Use the `System.env` function to read an environment variable and eventually use a default value if the variable is not set:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.System.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val port: (System, Raise[NumberFormatException]) ?=> Option[Int] = System.env[Int]("PORT")
val host: System ?=> String = System.env[String]("HOST", "localhost")
```

The same applies to system properties. Use the `System.property` function to read a system property and eventually use a default value if the property is not set:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.System.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val port: (System, Raise[NumberFormatException]) ?=> Option[Int] = System.property[Int]("server.port")
val host: System ?=> String = System.property[String]("server.host", "localhost")
```

The available types for properties and environment variables are:

- `String`: A string value.
- `Int`: An integer value.
- `Long`: A long value.
- `Double`: A double value.
- `Boolean`: A boolean value.
- `Float`: A float value.
- `Short`: A short value.
- `Byte`: A byte value.
- `Char`: A char value.

### The `State` Effect

The `State[S]` effect enables stateful computations in a purely functional manner. It provides operations to get, set, update, and use state values within a controlled scope, allowing you to work with mutable state without compromising functional programming principles.

The `State` effect manages a single piece of state of type `S` throughout a computation. All state operations are performed within the context of a `State.run` block, which provides isolation and ensures the state is properly managed.

**Note:** The State effect is not thread-safe. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms when accessing state from multiple threads.

#### Basic Usage

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.State.*

val (finalState, result) = State.run(0) {
  val current = State.get[Int]
  State.set(current + 5)
  State.get[Int]
}
// finalState = 5, result = 5
```

#### Updating State

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.State.*

val (finalState, result) = State.run(10) {
  val doubled = State.update[Int](_ * 2)
  val tripled = State.update[Int](_ * 3)
  tripled
}
// finalState = 60, result = 60
```

#### Using State Without Modification

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.State.*

case class User(name: String, age: Int)

val (finalState, nameLength) = State.run(User("Alice", 30)) {
  State.use[User, Int](_.name.length)
}
// finalState = User("Alice", 30), nameLength = 5
```

#### Combining with Other Effects

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.State.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Random.*

def randomWalk(steps: Int)(using State[Int], Random): Int = {
  if (steps <= 0) State.get[Int]
  else {
    val direction = if (Random.nextBoolean) 1 else -1
    State.update(_ + direction)
    randomWalk(steps - 1)
  }
}

val (finalPosition, result) = State.run(0) {
  Random.run {
    randomWalk(10)
  }
}
```

The `State` effect provides the following operations:
- `State.get[S]`: Retrieves the current state value without modifying it
- `State.set[S](value: S)`: Sets the state to a new value and returns the previous state value
- `State.update[S](f: S => S)`: Updates the state using a transformation function and returns the new state value
- `State.use[S, A](f: S => A)`: Applies a function to the current state and returns the result without modifying the state
- `State.run[S, A](initialState: S)(block: State[S] ?=> A)`: Runs a stateful computation with an initial state value, returning both the final state and the computation result

### The `Writer` Effect

The `Writer[W]` effect enables pure, append-only value accumulation during computations. Values are collected into a `Vector[W]` and returned alongside the computation result as a tuple `(Vector[W], A)`. This is useful for collecting logs, events, metrics, or any other data during a computation.

**Note:** The Writer effect is not thread-safe. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms when accessing from multiple threads.

#### Basic Usage

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Writer.*

val (log, result) = Writer.run[String, Int] {
  Writer.write("starting")
  Writer.write("computing")
  42
}
// log = Vector("starting", "computing"), result = 42
```

For more concise syntax, you can use the `writes` infix type:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Writer, writes}

def computation: Int writes String = {
  Writer.write("log entry")
  42
}
```

#### Writing Multiple Values

Use `writeAll` to append multiple values at once:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Writer.*

val (log, _) = Writer.run[Int, Unit] {
  Writer.write(1)
  Writer.writeAll(List(2, 3, 4))
  Writer.write(5)
}
// log = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

#### Capturing Writes

The `capture` operation records writes from a block, returning them alongside the block's result. Writes are also forwarded to the outer scope:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Writer.*

val (outerLog, (innerLog, result)) = Writer.run[String, (Vector[String], Int)] {
  Writer.write("before")
  val captured = Writer.capture[String, Int] {
    Writer.write("inside")
    99
  }
  Writer.write("after")
  captured
}
// outerLog = Vector("before", "inside", "after")
// innerLog = Vector("inside"), result = 99
```

#### Combining with Other Effects

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Writer.*
import in.rcard.yaes.State.*

val (state, (log, result)) = State.run(0) {
  Writer.run[String, Int] {
    Writer.write("start")
    State.update[Int](_ + 1)
    Writer.write(s"count=${State.get[Int]}")
    State.get[Int]
  }
}
// state = 1, log = Vector("start", "count=1"), result = 1
```

The `Writer` effect provides the following operations:
- `Writer.write[W](w: W)`: Appends a single value to the accumulated output
- `Writer.writeAll[W](ws: IterableOnce[W])`: Appends multiple values at once
- `Writer.capture[W, A](block: Writer[W] ?=> A)`: Captures writes from a block, forwarding them to the outer scope, and returns `(Vector[W], A)`
- `Writer.run[W, A](block: Writer[W] ?=> A)`: Runs a computation with the Writer effect, returning `(Vector[W], A)`

### The `Reader` Effect

The `Reader[R]` effect provides read-only access to an environment value of type `R`. It allows computations to read a shared value and temporarily override it via `local`, completing the classic Reader/Writer/State trio.

The environment value is immutable within a scope. The `local` operation creates a fresh scope with a modified value, restoring the original after the block completes. This makes `Reader` thread-safe by construction.

#### Basic Usage

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Reader

case class Config(maxRetries: Int, timeout: Int)

val result = Reader.run(Config(3, 5000)) {
  Reader.read[Config].maxRetries
}
// result = 3
```

For more concise syntax, you can use the `reads` infix type:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Reader, reads}

def getRetries: Int reads Config =
  Reader.read[Config].maxRetries
```

#### Local Overrides

Use `local` to temporarily modify the environment value for a block:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Reader

case class Config(maxRetries: Int, timeout: Int)

val result = Reader.run(Config(3, 5000)) {
  val before = Reader.read[Config].maxRetries        // 3
  val during = Reader.local(_.copy(maxRetries = 10)) {
    Reader.read[Config].maxRetries                    // 10
  }
  val after = Reader.read[Config].maxRetries          // 3 (restored)
  (before, during, after)
}
// result = (3, 10, 3)
```

#### Combining with Other Effects

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Raise, Reader, raises, reads}

case class Config(maxRetries: Int)

def validate(value: Int): Unit raises String reads Config = {
  val max = Reader.read[Config].maxRetries
  if (value > max) Raise.raise(s"$value exceeds max $max")
}

val result = Reader.run(Config(5)) {
  Raise.either[String, Unit] {
    validate(10)
  }
}
// result = Left("10 exceeds max 5")
```

The `Reader` effect provides the following operations:
- `Reader.read[R]`: Returns the current environment value
- `Reader.local[R, A](f: R => R)(block: Reader[R] ?=> A)`: Runs a block with a modified environment of the same type, restoring the original after
- `Reader.local[R1, R2, A](f: R1 => R2)(block: Reader[R2] ?=> A)`: Runs a block with a transformed environment value (possibly changing its type), restoring the original after
- `Reader.reader[R](value: R)`: Creates a `Reader[R]` capability from a concrete environment value; use this when you need to pass or provide the `Reader[R]` instance explicitly
- `Reader.run[R, A](value: R)(block: Reader[R] ?=> A)`: Runs a computation with the Reader effect, returning `A` directly; use this as the convenient entry point when you just want to execute a block that requires `Reader[R]`

### The `Log` Effect

The `Log` effect provides the capability to log messages at different levels. The available levels are:
  - `TRACE`
  - `DEBUG`
  - `INFO`
  - `WARN`
  - `ERROR`
  - `FATAL`
  
We can log using a concrete implementation of the `in.rcard.yaes.Logger` interface. Each logger instance has a name. To create a logger, we can use the `Log.getLogger` method:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Log.*

val logger: Log ?=> Logger = Log.getLogger("TestLogger")
```

In `yaes-core`, the default logger implementation is the `ConsoleLogger`, which logs messages to the console. The message printed to the console has the following format:

```
2025-04-22T19:55:59 - TRACE - TestLogger - Trace message
```

To run the effectful computation, we can use the provided handlers. The `Log.run` method accepts a `level` parameter that controls the minimum severity of messages that will be emitted. The default level is `Log.Level.Debug`:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Log.*

val program = Log.run(Log.Level.Info) {
  val logger = Log.getLogger("TestLogger")

  logger.debug("This will NOT be printed")
  logger.info("Info message")
}
```

It's possible to change the clock used by the logger. By default, the `java.time.Clock.systemDefaultZone()` is used. The clock is provided as a given parameter to the `Log.run` handler method. The default clock is defined as a given instance in the `Log` object.

```scala 3
object Log {
  given defaultClock: java.time.Clock = java.time.Clock.systemDefaultZone()
  // ...
}
```

#### SLF4J Integration

The `yaes-slf4j` module provides an alternative handler that delegates logging to any SLF4J-compatible backend (Logback, Log4j2, etc.). Simply replace `Log.run` with `Slf4jLog.run` — all existing application code remains unchanged:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Log
import in.rcard.yaes.slf4j.Slf4jLog

Slf4jLog.run {
  val logger = Log.getLogger("MyService")
  logger.info("Hello from SLF4J!")
}
```

Level filtering is controlled by the SLF4J backend configuration instead of a handler parameter. See the [yaes-slf4j README](yaes-slf4j/README.md) for full details.

### The Retry Handler

The `Retry` handler re-executes a failing block according to a `Schedule` retry policy. It catches typed errors via `Raise[E]` and uses `Async` for delays between attempts.

> **Note:** `Retry` is not an effect — it orchestrates existing effects (`Raise` and `Async`). The block being retried just runs, succeeds, or fails.

#### Schedule Policies

A `Schedule` computes the delay for each retry attempt. Schedules compose via chaining. The `jitter` extension requires the `Random` effect in scope:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*
import scala.concurrent.duration.*

// Fixed delay
val fixed = Schedule.fixed(500.millis)

// Exponential backoff with cap
val exponential = Schedule.exponential(100.millis, factor = 2.0, max = 30.seconds)

// Compose: exponential + jitter + max attempts
// jitter requires Random in scope; Random.run wraps the entire usage context
val composed: Either[DbError, String] = Random.run {
  Async.run {
    Raise.either {
      Retry[DbError](
        Schedule
          .exponential(100.millis, factor = 2.0, max = 30.seconds)
          .jitter(0.25)
          .attempts(5)
      ) {
        findUser(42)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Retry

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*
import scala.concurrent.duration.*

case class DbError(msg: String)

def findUser(id: Int)(using Raise[DbError]): String =
  Raise.raise(DbError("connection timeout"))

val result: Either[DbError, String] = Async.run {
  Raise.either {
    Retry[DbError](Schedule.fixed(500.millis).attempts(3)) {
      findUser(42)
    }
  }
}
// result will be Left(DbError("connection timeout")) after 3 total attempts
```

If the block succeeds on any attempt, its value is returned immediately. If all attempts are exhausted, the last error is re-raised via the outer `Raise[E]`. Only errors of the specified type `E` trigger retries — other error types propagate immediately.

#### Selective Retry with a Predicate

Pass a `retryable` predicate to control which errors trigger a retry. Errors where the predicate returns `false` are re-raised immediately:

```scala 3
sealed trait AppError
case class ConnectionError(host: String) extends AppError
case class AuthError(msg: String)        extends AppError

val result: Either[AppError, String] = Async.run {
  Raise.either {
    Retry[AppError](
      Schedule.exponential(100.millis).attempts(5),
      retryable = {
        case _: ConnectionError => true   // transient — retry
        case _: AuthError       => false  // permanent — re-raise immediately
      }
    ) {
      connect()
    }
  }
}
```

This also fixes a subtle contravariance bypass: because `Raise[-E]` is contravariant, a block that captures an outer `Raise[E | F]` may bypass `Retry`'s internal boundary. Widening `E` to the full union type and using `retryable` to discriminate ensures all errors flow through the same boundary.

The default is `retryable = _ => true`: all errors are retried, preserving existing behavior.

## Communication Primitives

Beyond effects, λÆS provides communication primitives for coordinating between asynchronous computations.

### Channels

A `Channel` is a communication primitive for transferring data between asynchronous computations (fibers). Conceptually, a channel is similar to `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`, but it has suspending operations instead of blocking ones and can be closed.

Channels are particularly useful when you need to:
- Share data between multiple fibers

#### Channel Types

Channels support different buffer configurations that control how elements are buffered and when senders/receivers suspend:

**Unbounded Channel**: A channel with unlimited buffer capacity that never suspends the sender.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val channel = Channel.unbounded[Int]()

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    Async.fork {
      // These sends will never suspend
      channel.send(1)
      channel.send(2)
      channel.send(3)
    }
  }
}
```

**Bounded Channel**: A channel with a fixed buffer capacity. When the buffer is full, behavior depends on the overflow policy (default is to suspend the sender).

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.OverflowStrategy
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

// Default: suspend when full
val channel1 = Channel.bounded[Int](capacity = 2)

// Drop oldest element when full
val channel2 = Channel.bounded[Int](capacity = 2, onOverflow = OverflowStrategy.DROP_OLDEST)

// Drop newest element when full
val channel3 = Channel.bounded[Int](capacity = 2, onOverflow = OverflowStrategy.DROP_LATEST)

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    Async.fork {
      channel1.send(1) // Succeeds immediately
      channel1.send(2) // Succeeds immediately
      channel1.send(3) // Suspends until receiver takes an element
    }
  }
}
```

**Buffer Overflow Policies**: Bounded channels support different strategies for handling buffer overflow:

- `OverflowStrategy.SUSPEND` (default): The sender suspends until space becomes available, providing backpressure
- `OverflowStrategy.DROP_OLDEST`: The oldest element in the buffer is dropped to make space for the new element
- `OverflowStrategy.DROP_LATEST`: The new element is discarded and the buffer remains unchanged

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.OverflowStrategy
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

// Channel that never suspends, dropping old elements when full
val channel = Channel.bounded[Int](capacity = 3, onOverflow = OverflowStrategy.DROP_OLDEST)

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    Async.fork {
      (1 to 5).foreach(channel.send) // Sends never suspend
      channel.close()
    }
    
    channel.foreach(println) // Prints: 3, 4, 5 (first two were dropped)
  }
}
```

**Rendezvous Channel**: A channel with no buffer. The sender and receiver must meet (rendezvous): `send` suspends until another computation invokes `receive`, and vice versa.

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val channel = Channel.rendezvous[String]()

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    val sender = Async.fork {
      channel.send("hello") // Suspends until receiver is ready
      println("Message sent")
    }

    val receiver = Async.fork {
      val msg = channel.receive() // Suspends until sender is ready
      println(s"Received: $msg")
    }
  }
}
```

#### Basic Operations

Channels are composed of two interfaces:
- **`SendChannel`**: For sending elements (can also close the channel)
- **`ReceiveChannel`**: For receiving elements (can also cancel the channel)

> **Note:** As of version 0.11.0, channel operations (`send`, `receive`, `cancel`, `foreach`) no longer require an `Async` context - they work with just a `Raise` context. This makes channels more flexible and accurately reflects their implementation using JVM synchronization primitives. Builder functions like `produce`, `channelFlow`, and `Flow.buffer` still require `Async` as they use structured concurrency.

**Sending and Receiving**:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val channel = Channel.unbounded[Int]()

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    // Producer fiber
    Async.fork {
      channel.send(1)
      channel.send(2)
      channel.send(3)
      channel.close() // Signal no more elements
    }

    // Consumer fiber
    channel.foreach { value =>
      println(s"Received: $value")
    }
    // Prints: Received: 1, Received: 2, Received: 3
  }
}
```

**Closing vs Canceling**:

- **`close()`**: Prevents further sends but allows receiving remaining buffered elements
- **`cancel()`**: Immediately clears all buffered elements and marks the channel as cancelled

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val channel = Channel.unbounded[Int]()

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    Async.fork {
      channel.send(1)
      channel.send(2)
    }
    channel.close() // No more sends allowed
    
    println(channel.receive()) // Prints: 1
    println(channel.receive()) // Prints: 2
    // channel.receive() // Would raise ChannelClosed
  }
}
```

#### Producer DSL

The `produce` and `produceWith` functions provide a convenient DSL for creating channels with producer coroutines:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.Producer
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    // Create an unbounded channel with a producer
    val channel = Channel.produce[Int] {
      (1 to 10).foreach { i =>
        Producer.send(i * i)
      }
      // Channel automatically closed when block completes
    }

    // Consume the produced elements
    channel.foreach { value =>
      println(s"Square: $value")
    }
  }
}
```

You can also specify the channel type with `produceWith`:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.Producer
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    // Create a bounded producer with backpressure
    val channel = Channel.produceWith(Channel.Type.Bounded(5)) {
      var count = 0
      while (count < 100) {
        Producer.send(count)
        count += 1
      }
    }

    // Consume with backpressure
    channel.foreach { value =>
      Async.delay(100.millis) // Slow consumer
      println(value)
    }
  }
}
```

#### Channel Flow Builder

The `channelFlow` and `channelFlowWith` functions provide a bridge between channels and flows, creating cold flows where elements are emitted through a `Producer` context. Unlike `produce`, which returns a `ReceiveChannel`, `channelFlow` returns a `Flow` that can be composed with flow operators.

**Basic usage with `channelFlow`:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*

val flow = Channel.channelFlow[Int] {
  Channel.Producer.send(1)
  Channel.Producer.send(2)
  Channel.Producer.send(3)
}

val result = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]()
flow.collect { value => result += value }
// result contains: 1, 2, 3
```

**With custom channel type using `channelFlowWith`:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val flow = Channel.channelFlowWith[Int](Channel.Type.Bounded(5)) {
  (1 to 100).foreach(Channel.Producer.send)
}

val result = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]()
flow.collect { value => result += value }
// result contains: 1 to 100
```

**Concurrent emission from multiple fibers:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val flow = Channel.channelFlow[Int] {
  Async.fork {
    Channel.Producer.send(1)
    Channel.Producer.send(2)
  }

  Async.fork {
    Channel.Producer.send(3)
    Channel.Producer.send(4)
  }
}


val result = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]()
flow.collect { value => result += value }
// result contains all four values
```

**Merging multiple flows:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Channel, Flow}
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

def merge[T](flow1: Flow[T], flow2: Flow[T]): Flow[T] =
  Channel.channelFlow[T] {
    Async.fork {
      flow1.collect { value => Channel.Producer.send(value) }
    }

    Async.fork {
      flow2.collect { value => Channel.Producer.send(value) }
    }
  }

val flow1 = Flow(1, 2, 3)
val flow2 = Flow(4, 5, 6)

val result = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]()
merge(flow1, flow2).collect { value => result += value }
// result contains all six values
```

Key features:
- **Cold execution**: The builder block executes every time `collect` is called on the flow
- **Concurrent emission**: Supports multiple fibers sending to the same producer
- **Flow composition**: Returns a `Flow` that can be used with all flow operators (map, filter, take, etc.)

**Design Decision: Internal vs External `Async` Context**

You might notice that `channelFlow` doesn't require an external `Async` effect to run, unlike combinators such as `par` and `race`. This is intentional:

| Category | Examples | `Async` Required | Reason |
|----------|----------|------------------|--------|
| **Combinators** | `par`, `race`, `zipWith` | Yes (external) | Compose existing computations; caller controls concurrency scope |
| **Builders** | `channelFlow`, `Flow.flow` | No (internal) | Encapsulate their own effects; `Async.run` is part of `collect` implementation |

This design ensures that `channelFlow` produces a standard `Flow[T]` that can be used anywhere a `Flow` is expected, without leaking concurrency requirements to callers. The `Async.run` is invoked internally when `collect` is called, making each collection trigger a fresh concurrent computation.

#### Flow Buffering

The `buffer` operator allows flow emissions to be buffered via a channel, enabling the producer (upstream flow) and consumer (downstream collector) to run concurrently. This can improve performance when emissions and collection have different speeds.

**Basic usage with unbounded buffer (default):**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Channel, Flow}
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.buffer

val flow = Flow(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

val result = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]()
flow.buffer().collect { value => result += value }
// result contains: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

**With bounded buffer for backpressure:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Channel, Flow}
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.buffer

val flow = Flow(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

val result = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]()
flow.buffer(Channel.Type.Bounded(2)).collect { value => result += value }
// result contains: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

**With overflow strategies:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Channel, Flow}
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.{buffer, OverflowStrategy}
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import scala.concurrent.duration.*

// DROP_OLDEST: drops oldest buffered values when full
Async.run {
  val flow1 = Flow(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  flow1.buffer(Channel.Type.Bounded(2, OverflowStrategy.DROP_OLDEST)).collect { value =>
    Async.delay(100.millis) // Slow consumer
    println(value)
  }
}
// May print: 1, 4, 5 (oldest values dropped)

// DROP_LATEST: drops new values when buffer is full
Async.run {
  val flow2 = Flow(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  flow2.buffer(Channel.Type.Bounded(2, OverflowStrategy.DROP_LATEST)).collect { value =>
    Async.delay(100.millis) // Slow consumer
    println(value)
  }
}
// May print: 1, 2, 3 (latest values dropped)
```

Key features:
- **Cold operator**: The producer doesn't start until `collect` is called
- **Concurrent execution**: Producer and consumer run in separate fibers
- **Configurable buffering**: Supports unbounded, bounded, and rendezvous channels
- **Overflow strategies**: SUSPEND (default), DROP_OLDEST, or DROP_LATEST for bounded channels

#### Reactive Streams Integration

λÆS provides seamless integration with Java Reactive Streams through the `FlowPublisher` class. This allows you to convert YAES Flows into standard `java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher` instances that can be consumed by any Reactive Streams-compliant library.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Interoperability**: Integrate with reactive frameworks like Akka Streams, Project Reactor, and RxJava
- **Backpressure**: Leverage Reactive Streams demand management and backpressure protocol
- **Spec Compliance**: Fully compliant with the Reactive Streams specification
- **Type-Safe**: Maintains type safety throughout the conversion

**Basic Usage:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Flow, FlowPublisher}
import in.rcard.yaes.FlowPublisher.asPublisher
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import java.util.concurrent.Flow.{Subscriber, Subscription}

val flow = Flow(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Async.run {
  val publisher = flow.asPublisher()

  publisher.subscribe(new Subscriber[Int] {
    var subscription: Subscription = _

    override def onSubscribe(s: Subscription): Unit = {
      subscription = s
      s.request(10)  // Request elements with backpressure
    }

    override def onNext(item: Int): Unit = {
      println(s"Received: $item")
      subscription.request(1)  // Request next element
    }

    override def onError(t: Throwable): Unit =
      println(s"Error: ${t.getMessage}")

    override def onComplete(): Unit =
      println("Completed")
  })
}
```

**With Custom Buffer Configuration:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Flow, Channel}
import in.rcard.yaes.FlowPublisher.asPublisher

val flow = Flow(1 to 100: _*)

val publisher = flow.asPublisher(
  bufferCapacity = Channel.Type.Bounded(32, Channel.OverflowStrategy.SUSPEND)
)
```

**Using Factory Methods:**

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.{Flow, FlowPublisher}

// Default buffer capacity (16, SUSPEND)
val publisher1 = FlowPublisher.fromFlow(flow)

// Custom buffer capacity
val publisher2 = FlowPublisher.fromFlow(
  flow,
  Channel.Type.Bounded(64, Channel.OverflowStrategy.SUSPEND)
)
```

Key features:
- **Cold execution**: Each subscription triggers independent Flow execution
- **Demand-driven**: Respects subscriber's `request(n)` for backpressure
- **Buffered**: Channel buffers elements between Flow producer and Subscriber consumer
- **Cancellable**: Subscribers can cancel to stop emission and clean up resources
- **Error propagation**: Flow errors are propagated to subscriber's `onError`
- **Concurrent**: Uses fibers internally for producer and consumer coordination

For comprehensive documentation including demand management, backpressure patterns, error handling, and best practices, see the [Reactive Streams Integration documentation](https://rcardin.github.io/yaes/data-structures.html#reactive-streams-integration).

#### Error Handling

Channel operations can raise `ChannelClosed` errors. These must be handled using the `Raise` effect:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.ChannelClosed
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

val result: ChannelClosed | String = Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    val channel = Channel.unbounded[String]()
    channel.close()
    
    // This will raise ChannelClosed
    channel.send("too late!")
  }
}
```

#### Practical Example: Pipeline Pattern

Channels are excellent for building data processing pipelines:

```scala 3
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel
import in.rcard.yaes.Channel.Producer
import in.rcard.yaes.Async.*
import in.rcard.yaes.Raise.*

case class User(id: Int, name: String)

def processUsers(): Unit = Raise.run {
  Async.run {
    // Stage 1: Generate user IDs
    val idsChannel = Channel.produce[Int] {
      (1 to 100).foreach(Producer.send)
    }

    // Stage 2: Fetch users (with bounded channel for backpressure)
    val usersChannel = Channel.produceWith[User](Channel.Type.Bounded(10)) {
      idsChannel.foreach { id =>
        val user = User(id, s"User$id") // Simulate fetch
        Producer.send(user)
      }
    }

    // Stage 3: Process users
    usersChannel.foreach { user =>
      println(s"Processing: ${user.name}")
      // Do actual processing...
    }
  }
}
```

   > […] You might think of an effectful computation as one which performs an action outside of its local scope compared to one which simply returns a calculable value. […] So when functional programmers talk about managing effects, they're talking about expressing the basic logic of their programs within some guard rails provided by data structures or programming language constructs.

4. [Effect Oriented Programming, by Bill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward](https://effectorientedprogramming.com/)
   > An Effect is an unpredictable interaction, usually with an external system. […] An Effect System manages Effects by wrapping these calls. […] Unpredictable elements are Side Effects. […] A Side Effect occurs when calling a function changes the context of that function. […] There’s an important difference: Side Effects are unmanaged and Effects are managed. A Side Effect “just happens” but an Effect is explicitly tracked and controlled. […] With an Effect System, we manage Effect behavior by putting that Effect in a kind of box. […] An Effect System provides a set of components that replace Side-Effecting functions in standard libraries, along with the structure for managing Effectful functions that you write. An Effect System enables us to add almost any functionality to a program. […] Managing an Effect means we not only control what results are produced by a function like `nextInt()`, but also when those results are produced. The control of when is called deferred execution. Deferred execution is part of the solution for easily attaching functionality to an existing program. […] Deferring the execution of an Effect is part of what enables us to add functionality to that Effect. […] If Effects ran immediately, we could not freely add behaviors. […] When we manage an Effect, we hold a value that represents something that can be run but hasn’t yet.

7. [Essential Effects, by Adam Rosien](https://essentialeffects.dev/)
   > we’ll distinguish two aspects of code: computing values and interacting with the environment. At the same time, we’ll talk about how transparent, or not, our code can be in describing these aspects. […] To understand what plusOne does, you don’t have to look anywhere except the (literal) definition of plusOne. There are no references to anything outside of it. This is sometimes referred to as local reasoning. Under substitution, programs mean the same thing if they evaluate to the same value. 13 + 1 means exactly the same thing as 14. So does plusOne(12 + 1), or even (12 + 1) + 1. This is known as referential transparency. […] If we impose some conditions, we can tame the side effects into something safer; we’ll call these effects. […] The type of the program should tell us what kind of effects the program will perform, in addition to the type of the value it will produce. If the behavior we want relies upon some externally-visible side effect, we separate describing the effects we want to happen from actually making them happen. We can freely substitute the description of effects until the point we run them. […] We delay the side effect so it executes outside of any evaluation, ensuring substitution still holds within. We’ll call these conditions the Effect Pattern. […] We can construct individual effects, and run them, but how do we combine them? We may want to modify the output of an effect (via map), or use the output of an effect to create a new effect (via flatMap). But be careful! Composing effects must not execute them.
