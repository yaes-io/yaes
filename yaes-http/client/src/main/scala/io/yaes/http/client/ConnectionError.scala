/** Transport-level errors that occur before an HTTP response is received.

  * These errors represent failures in the network layer, such as the server being unreachable,

  * Example:
  * {{{
  * val result = Raise.either[ConnectionError, HttpResponse] {
  *   client.send(HttpRequest.get(uri))
  * }
  * result match
  *   case Left(ConnectionError.ConnectionRefused(host, port)) => // handle
  *   case Left(ConnectionError.ConnectTimeout(host))          => // handle
  *   case Right(response)                                     => // success
