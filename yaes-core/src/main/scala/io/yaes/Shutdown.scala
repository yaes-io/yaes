/** Graceful shutdown coordination for YAES applications.
  *
  * Provides state management and callback hooks for coordinating graceful shutdown across
  * concurrent operations. Automatically registers JVM shutdown hooks to handle SIGTERM/SIGINT
  * signals.
  *
  * **Shutdown Flow:**
  *   1. JVM receives SIGTERM/SIGINT (or user calls [[initiateShutdown]])
  *   2. State transitions to SHUTTING_DOWN
  *   3. All registered hooks are invoked
  *   4. Application checks [[isShuttingDown]] to reject new work
  *   5. Existing work completes (managed by [[Async]] structured concurrency)
  *
  * Example - Simple shutdown:
  * {{{
  * Shutdown.run {
  *   while (!Shutdown.isShuttingDown()) {
  *     // Process work
  *   }
  *   // Cleanup happens here
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * Example - With hooks:
  * {{{
  * Shutdown.run {
  *   Resource.run {
  *     val db = Resource.acquire(openDatabase())
  *
  *     Shutdown.onShutdown(() => {
  *       println("Shutdown initiated, stopping work acceptance")
  *     })
  *
  *     while (!Shutdown.isShuttingDown()) {
  *       processJob(db)
  *     }
  *     // Resource cleanup happens automatically
  *   }
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * Example - Daemon server (with Async):
  * {{{
  * Shutdown.run {
  *   Async.run {
  *     val server = Async.fork {
  *       startServer()
  *     }
  *
  *     // Wait until shutdown is initiated
  *     while (!Shutdown.isShuttingDown()) {
  *       Async.delay(100.millis)
  *     }
  *
  *     server.cancel()
  *   }
  * }
  * }}}

    *
    * **Automatically triggered by:**
    *   - JVM shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT, Ctrl+C)
    *   - Container stop (Docker, Kubernetes)
    *
    * **Manually triggered for:**
    *   - Tests (controlled shutdown)

    * they were registered. Each hook is wrapped in exception handling - if a hook throws, other
    * hooks will still execute.
    *
    * **Use cases:**
    *   - Notify async scopes to begin graceful termination
    *   - Log shutdown initiation
    *   - Trigger application-specific shutdown logic
    *
    * **Note:** For resource cleanup (closing files, connections, etc.), prefer the [[Resource]]
    * effect which guarantees LIFO cleanup order.
