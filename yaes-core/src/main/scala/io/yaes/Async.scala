    * cooperative interruption, and the method returns only after cancellation has propagated.
    *
    * This mirrors an Ox-style unsupervised scope: the supervision model is a property of the active
    * scope, not of the [[fork]] call, so `Async.fork` is reused unchanged. A fiber that fails and
    * is never joined does not propagate its exception to the enclosing scope, and sibling fibers
    * are not cancelled when one of them fails. To observe a fiber's failure, join it explicitly
    * with [[Fiber.join]] or [[Fiber.value]].

    * An exception thrown from the main body of the block still propagates to the caller.

  /** Runs an async computation with graceful shutdown support and timeout enforcement.
    *
    * This method wraps an async computation in a [[GracefulShutdownScope]] that coordinates with
    * the [[Shutdown]] effect. When shutdown is initiated, the scope allows in-flight work to
    * complete gracefully within the specified deadline before cancelling remaining fibers.
    *
    * **Behavior:**
    *   - The main task (the `block` parameter) runs normally within the async scope
    *   - When `Shutdown.initiateShutdown()` is called, the scope is notified via the registered
    *     shutdown hook
    *   - When the main task completes, the scope shuts down immediately and cancels remaining
    *     fibers
    *   - If the main task doesn't complete within the deadline after shutdown is initiated, the
    *     timeout enforcer triggers, remaining fibers are cancelled via cooperative interruption,
    *     and [[ShutdownTimedOut]] is raised
    *   - Any forked fibers that fail with an exception cause immediate scope shutdown (fail-fast)
    *
    * **Lifecycle:**
    *   1. Main task and any forked fibers start running
    *   1. Shutdown is initiated (via JVM hook or `Shutdown.initiateShutdown()`)
    *   1. Shutdown hook triggers `scope.initiateGracefulShutdown()`
    *   1. Main task continues running, allowing cleanup code to execute
    *   1. When main task completes, scope shuts down and cancels remaining fibers
    *   1. If deadline expires before main task completes, remaining fibers are cancelled and
    *      [[ShutdownTimedOut]] is raised
    *   1. `scope.join()` completes when all fibers finish (or are cancelled)
    *
    * **Integration with Shutdown Effect:** This method returns
    * `(Shutdown, Raise[ShutdownTimedOut]) ?=> A`, meaning it requires both a Shutdown context and a
    * Raise[ShutdownTimedOut] context. It automatically registers a hook with `Shutdown.onShutdown`
    * to trigger graceful shutdown when the Shutdown effect transitions to shutting down state.
    *
    * **Error Handling:** When the deadline expires before the main task completes, the method
    * raises [[ShutdownTimedOut]]. Handle this error using `Raise.either`, `Raise.run`, or other
    * Raise handlers.
    *
    * Example:
    * {{{
    * Shutdown.run {
    *   Raise.either {
    *     Async.withGracefulShutdown(Deadline.after(30.seconds)) {
    *       val serverFiber = Async.forkNamed("server") {
    *         while (!Shutdown.isShuttingDown()) {
    *           handleRequest()
    *         }
    *         // Graceful cleanup after shutdown initiated
    *       }
    *       serverFiber.join()
    *     }
    *   }
    * } // Returns Either[ShutdownTimedOut, Unit]
    * }}}

    *   async.delay(Duration(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
    *

    *     // Some long-running task
    *     42
