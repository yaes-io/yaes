/** Companion object providing convenient methods for working with the `Resource` effect.
  *
  * The `Resource` effect provides automatic resource management with guaranteed cleanup. It ensures
  * that all acquired resources are properly released in LIFO order, even when exceptions occur.
  * This is particularly useful for managing files, database connections, network connections, and
  * other resources that need explicit cleanup.
  *
  * Key features:
  *   - Automatic resource cleanup in reverse order of acquisition (LIFO)
  *   - Exception safety - resources are cleaned up even if exceptions occur
  *   - Support for any type of resource with custom release functions
  *   - Built-in support for `AutoCloseable` resources
  *   - Support for simple cleanup actions via finalizers
  *
  * Example Usage:
  * {{{
  * import java.io.{FileInputStream, FileOutputStream}
  * 
  * Resource.run {
  *   val input = Resource.acquire(new FileInputStream("input.txt"))
  *   val output = Resource.acquire(new FileOutputStream("output.txt"))
  *   
  *   // Custom resource management
  *   val connection = Resource.install(openDatabaseConnection()) { conn =>
  *     conn.close()
  *     println("Database connection closed")
  *   }
  *   
  *   // Simple cleanup action
  *   Resource.ensuring {
  *     println("Cleanup completed")
  *   }
  *   
  *   // Use resources safely - they will be automatically cleaned up
  *   processFiles(input, output, connection)
  * }
  * // All resources are automatically closed here, even if exceptions occurred
  * }}}

    * All resources acquired within the block are guaranteed to be cleaned up in reverse order
    * (LIFO - Last In, First Out) when the block completes, whether successfully or with an exception.
    *
    * Resource cleanup is exception-safe:
    * - If the main program throws an exception, cleanup still occurs
    * - If cleanup itself throws exceptions, they are handled appropriately
    * - Original exceptions from the main program are preserved
