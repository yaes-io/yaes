/** A channel implementation that supports both sending and receiving operations.
  *
  * This class implements both [[Channel.SendChannel]] and [[Channel.ReceiveChannel]], providing
  * full bidirectional channel operations.
  *
  * The channel maintains internal state to track whether it's open, closed, or cancelled:
  *   - '''Open''': Normal operation; send and receive work normally
  *   - '''Closed''': No more sends allowed; remaining buffered elements can still be received
  *   - '''Cancelled''': All buffered elements are cleared; operations fail immediately
  *
  * Example usage:
  * {{{
  * val channel = Channel.bounded[String](10)
  *
  * Raise.run {
  *   Async.run {
  *     // Producer fiber
  *     Async.fork {
