## yaes-migration

Scalafix syntactic migration rules, published as `io.yaes:yaes-migration_2.13`. Consumers add a single line to their build (`scalafixDependencies += "io.yaes" %% "yaes-migration"`) and run the rules against their own YAES sources. Sources live under `yaes-migration/rules/`.

### Why This Module Is Scala 2.13 (not `_3`)

Every other YAES module targets Scala 3, but this one is compiled with Scala 2.13 on purpose. External Scalafix rules (those pulled in via `scalafixDependencies`) are loaded by the `scalafix-reflect_2.13` layer, so `scalafixDependencies += "io.yaes" %% "yaes-migration"` resolves `_2.13` regardless of the consumer's own Scala version. A `_3` build does compile (Scalafix's own `scalafix-rules_3` does the same via `for3Use2_13`), but it rides inside the CLI classpath and is not reachable as an external rule, so publishing `_3` would break that one-line setup. The `scalaVersion` override and the rationale live in the `yaes-migration` section of the root `build.sbt`.

### How a Rule Rewrites Code

`MigrateV021ToV022` migrates the 0.21.0 package layout (`in.rcard.yaes`) to the 0.22.0 layout (`io.yaes`). It works in two passes because comments are invisible to a syntax tree:

1. **Tree pass.** Package declarations, imports of every style, and fully-qualified type references all contain the same three-segment `Term.Select` node whose syntax is exactly `in.rcard.yaes`. Matching that innermost node and replacing it with `io.yaes` rewrites every code-level case uniformly.
2. **Comment pass.** A separate iteration over the token stream string-replaces the old prefix inside every `Token.Comment`, covering inline `//` comments and `/** ... */` Scaladoc (including `{{{ }}}` code examples).

Both passes are idempotent: a migrated source has no matching tree node and no old prefix left in its comments.

### Adding a Future Migration Rule

1. Add a new rule class under `rules/src/main/scala/io/yaes/migration/` extending `SyntacticRule` (or `SemanticRule` if it needs symbol information).
2. Register it in `rules/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/scalafix.v1.Rule` (one fully-qualified class name per line). Scalafix discovers rules through this service file, so an unregistered rule will not load.

### Tests

Tests use Scalafix testkit's `AbstractSyntacticRuleSuite`. Each case is a pair of resource files under `rules/src/test/resources/migration/<name>/`: `input.scala` is fed to the rule and the result is compared against `output.scala`. `RuleSuite` also re-runs every case as `output` against `output`, so each pair doubles as an idempotency check. To add a case, drop a new `input.scala`/`output.scala` pair and a `checkPair("<name>")` call in `RuleSuite`.
